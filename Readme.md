### Problem Statement
> The company's lead conversion rate is currently suboptimal, and there is a need to develop a predictive model that can assign lead scores based on the probability of conversion. The ultimate goal is to improve the conversion rate and prioritize leads with higher potential for conversion.

### Business Goal
> The primary objective of this cas study is to build a logistic regression model that can predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer. By identifying the key factors that influence conversion probability, the company can focus its efforts on high-potential leads and tailor its marketing strategies accordingly. Thus converting more customers & ultimately generating more revenue.

### Dataset and Data Dictionary
The following files are present inside datasets folder:
- Leads.csv (dataset)
- Leads Data Dictionary.xlsx (data dictionary)

## Approach

> Case Study has been carried out in the following steps:
- Reading & Understanding Dataset
- Data Wrangaling
- Data Vizualization
- Dat Preparation
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation & Prediction

## Results and Conclusions

> The logistic regression model demonstrates strong predictive performance in identifying leads with a higher likelihood of conversion. The top features contributing to lead conversion were `Tags`, `Last Activity` & `Lead Source`.
> Also dummy variables which contributes most to the prediction are `Tags_Closed by Horizzon`, `Tags_Lost to EINS`, `Tags_Will revert after reading the email`, `Lead Source_Welingak Website` & `Last Activity_SMS Sent`.

> Also the accuracy, sensitivity & specificity for the both Test & Train data split came very close which ultimately gives confidence in the generated lead scores.

> The stakeholders shouldkeep these points in mind before taking any major decision going forward
